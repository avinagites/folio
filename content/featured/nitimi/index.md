Nitimi is a web-based software that runs as a webapp on browsers. You can use it to build and facilitate your web presence; but also a platform for having users follow, participate and contribute to your activities. Whether it's for a festival, an association, non-profit, family, small or medium business, government agencies, or artists collective, Nitimi will probably work for you very well.
